Introduction to Case

#### Ginny is a big fan of Japanese food, so she decided to start a restaurant at the beginning of 2021 that sells his three favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. Ginny's Diner needs your help to stay afloat – the restaurant has collected some fundamental data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use it to help them operate the business.

### Ginny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their:

visiting patterns,
how much money they’ve spent, and
which menu items are their favorite.
This deeper connection with her customers will help her deliver a better and more personalized experience for her loyal customers. She plans on using these insights to help him decide whether she should expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, she needs help to generate some essential datasets so her team can quickly inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

## The data set contains the following three tables, which you may refer to in the relationship diagram below to understand the connection:

#### Food 
#### Members
#### Menu
#### Orders
#### Orders_details
#### Restaurants
